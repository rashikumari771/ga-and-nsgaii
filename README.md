# Genetic Algorithms and NSGA-II Optimization Project

## Introduction

This project implements two evolutionary optimization algorithms: Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). The algorithms are designed to solve optimization problems by mimicking natural selection and genetic processes.


## Installation and Setup
everything is explained for nsgaii same can be followd for ga also
requirements : windows + visual studio + git plot

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/pratapavinesh/nsgaii.git
   ```

2. Compile the source files using a CMake: 

3. Run the compiled executables to execute the algorithms:
1. you can directly run in visual studio or run this command
   ```
   ./.\out\build\x64-debug\nsgaii\nsgaii.exe  
   ```

## Usage

- Modify the problem-specific classes (`assignment_problem.h` and `assignment_problem.cpp`) to define custom optimization problems.
- Adjust algorithm parameters and settings directly in the source files (`nsgaii.ini`) as needed.
- Run the algorithms and observe the results for different optimization problems.
